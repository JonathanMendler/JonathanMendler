### Hi there! Thanks for checking in âœ…

I'm a full-stack software developer currently enrolled in the Actualize Bootcamp. My focus has been based around Ruby on Rails, HTML, & CSS, with a litany of other languages planned for the future. 

- Fun fact: In my off time, you can find me live streaming over at my Twitch channel, [JohnnyOnTheMend](https://www.twitch.tv/johnnyonthemend). It's an inclusive community that prides itself on being supportive of one another, while also getting our fill of retro and current horror games! ðŸ‘»
